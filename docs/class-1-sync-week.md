# Welcome to Sync Week!
##  _What_ does it mean to host Zcash.

A validator node for Zcash verifys and relays transactions, while maintaining a full copy of the blockchain ledger, and contributing to the consensus process that secures the network. Validator nodes independently check the validity of new blocks and transactions according to the protocol rules, help propagate data to other nodes, and ensure the integrity and decentralization of the blockchain. This typically requires reliable hardware, sufficient storage and bandwidth, and a secure, always-on internet connection.

[TODO: Insert a relevant diagram/picture]

## TLDR
    1. Set up a VM on hardware of choice 
    2. Clone the git repo (https://github.com/zecrocks/zcash-stack) 
        â—¦ Or our competitors (https://github.com/stakeholdrs/zcash-infra)
    3. Sync the blockchain (from scratch in ~10days or from download-snapshot.sh in ~10hours)
    4. Launch the containers via Docker or Kubernetes on your VM
    5. Connect your new node to a wallet (perhaps using Cloudflare or Tailscale tunnel)
    6. Sit back and sip a red-bull knowing you are providing diversity and reliability to the privacy-coin Zcash ecosystem

## Decide _Where_ to host Zcash.
Servers are special computers made with high-quality components to help them function for long periods of time with no downtime.

### External Hosting
Many companies around the world offer servers for rent, hosted in special buildings called datacenters which are built to provide reliable power, cooling, and security. These companies are called "hosts" or "hosting providers" - and for big-tech's hosting offerings, "public clouds".

Renting an entire computer, a server just for yourself, is called renting a "dedicated server".

You can rent a portion of a server for a much lower price. Computer chips today offer many security features that allow multiple people to share a computer safely, without being able to access or affect each other's information or apps.

Renting a portion of a computer is called renting a "virtual machine" or "VM" for short.

For this workshop, we recommend renting a VM in Google Cloud using the $300 of free credits that they give to new users. But if you're feeling adventurous, check out the hundreds of options on ServerHunter.com. You'll want 300gb of disk space, and at least 4gb of RAM.

Chat with us on Session before paying for something, we'll help you verify that it's a good option.

### Self-hosting Zcash
But computers are everywhere! You might even have an extra one in your house.

It can be fun to host useful things on computers in your house. Many people do this, even using multiple computers - it's called a "home lab"!

There are downsides to hosting something at home, however:
1. The computer needs to be online all of the time, never rebooting, and ideally is on a battery backup.
2. You risk revealing information to the world about where you live, through IP address leaks. (a unique identifier that your internet provider gives to your network)
3. If a hacker got access to your server, they could potentially access your home network unless you take advanced precautions.

If you're comfortable with the risks, go for it! We're happy to help and will release specific guides for this in the days ahead. We run a home lab ourselves!

## Decide _How_ to host Zcash.
Docker vs. Kubernetes: A Showdown

- Docker (noun): a person who loads and unloads shipping containers at a marine dock
- Docker (noun): a small town in England
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (noun): an open-source software project automating the deployment of applications inside software containers 

vs

- Kubernetes (noun): Greek work meaning a helmsman or pilot responsible for steering a ship
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) (noun): an open-source system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications

Zec.rocks runs on dedicated servers that we maintain around the world, running Zcash on an easy Kubernetes distribution called "k3s". However, as Docker can be an easier entry-point for newcomers, we recommend starting with Docker.

### Docker
Docker is a tool that packages apps and everything they need (code, dependencies, system tools) into standardized containers, so they run the same anywhere. It's like a shipping container for software: keeping it isolated, portable, and easy to run on any computer.

### Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a system that runs lots of containers across multiple computers and makes sure that the software stays online, even if some of the computers stop working. It can even grow and shrink automatically throughout the day. If more people need the software, it adds more computers and containers; if fewer people use it, it removes the extras to save money.

The major public clouds have Kubernetes platforms which offer many cool features. But they're a bit expensive, and are centralized. If you're okay with that, we recommend using Google's $300 of free credits to try Google Kubernetes Engine.

A great thing about Kubernetes is that you don't have to run it on a major cloud, you can run it yourself, even on one computer. You lose the benefits of a large company's reliability, but you gain independence. 

# Lightwallets, Servers, Action!
## Action Item 1: Pick a Hosting Provider

Google Cloud offers $300 in free credits, and is our recommendation for people looking for the least technical path forward.

[Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/) is another option for hosting services.

Feeling adventurous? Browse ServerHunter.com for options. But contact us before paying for one, we'll help you make sure that you are picking a good option.

Remember, Zcash is decentralized software! You can completely delete it and start over fresh as many times as you like. You will not cause harm to the blockchain, it is synchronized across many computers around the world.

It's important to note that we will not be storing any money in our Zcash nodes, we are contributing to the decentralization of the network instead of using its wallet functionality. So, try a few hosts out, and both our Docker and Kubernetes approaches, if you'd really like to learn about hosting! You can always reinstall and try again.

Server Requirements: 
- At least 300GB of available disk space
- Minimum 4GB of RAM

## Action Item 2: Configure Your Server

Want to use the Docker method? [Docker process.](https://github.com/zecrocks/zcash-stack/tree/main/docker)
Want to use the Kubernetes method? [Kubernetes process.](https://github.com/zecrocks/zcash-stack/tree/main/charts)

## Action Item 3: Sync the Blockchain

The Zcash blockchain is ~275gb and can take over a week to download and synchronize. Through this process, your new server will validate each transcation in the blockchain, which can be a lengthy process. 

Another option, is to download a snapshot of the blockchain as starting point, and then let the server validate each new subsequent transcation. This assumes that the snapshot maker has an accurate copy of the history of the blockchain. 

Optional: Download a snapshot of the zcash blockchain (likely takes a few hours)
```
./docker/download-snapshot.sh
```

## Action Item 4: Connect your Server to a Lightwallet

Let's talk about personal privacy and sheilding IP address. Now that we have a server running, we will want to connect it to the outside world but in such a way, that we aren't revealing information about ourselves. While older generation shipped massive books of phones numbers and address to every resident in the neighborhood; we don't want to broadcast our IP address and other personal information out to every resident of the internet. 

Consider 3 options:
- Cloud-provided static IP address
- IP-obscuring Tunnels 
- Anonymous Traffic Routing (currently unavailable)

![Connecting your server to a Lightwallet](images/node_to_lightwallet_ways.png)

### Cloud-provided static IP address

If using a cloud provider like Google Clout or Vultr, they will supply an IP address (seperate from your home IP address) of which can be directly connected to a lightwallet. This provides protection, and is the simplest method. 

### IP-Obscuring Tunnels
[Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) and [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) are both tunnels that lets you route traffic from the broader internet to a local server. These options would be good for those who are self-hosting or want additional protection on cloud-provided hosting services.

### Anonymous Traffic Routing

!["Orges are like onion, they have layers." meme](images/Shrek.jpg)

Shrek has layers like an onion. Onion browsers like [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/), route traffic through a series of servers. Like wading through Shrek's swamp, this removes any traces of the path from origin to destination. Like a game of telephone, the packets are passed from node to node, each time stripping off information from it's past. Unlike a game of telephone, the original message arrives encrypted and intact.


Note: Currently no publicaly available lightwallets support TOR/onion addresses.

## Action Item 5: Monitoring

Occasionally check if your server is running using zecrock tools: [hosh Monitoring Tool](https://hosh.zec.rocks/zec)

Slip away into the night, knowing your server is running and you've done a small service to Zcash ecosystem by ensuring the Right to Transact for future generations. Find a cozy spot, sit back, and sip a red-bull knowing you are providing diversity and reliability to the privacy-coin Zcash ecosystem.
