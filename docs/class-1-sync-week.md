# Welcome to Sync Week!

Let's get started! The Zcash blockchain is 275gb and can take over a week to download and synchronize.

Quick update: We will start tracking server uptime on February 17th, so you will have around two weeks to get yours working. Remember: we’re here to help! Message us on Session any time for support.

## First: Decide _Where_ to host Zcash.
(Non-technical or don’t care? Use Google Cloud and Docker. Skip to the instructions below.)

Servers are special computers that made specially with high-quality components to help them function for long periods of time with no downtime.

Many companies around the world offer servers for rent, hosted in special buildings called datacenters which are built to provide reliable power, cooling, and security. These companies are called “hosts” or “hosting providers” - and for big-tech’s hosting offerings, “public clouds”.

Renting an entire computer, a server just for yourself, is called renting a “dedicated server”.

You can rent a portion of a server for a much lower price. Computer chips today offer many security features that allow multiple people to share a computer safely, without being able to access or affect each other’s information or apps.

Renting a portion of a computer is called renting a “virtual machine” or “VM” for short.

For this workshop, we recommend renting a VM in Google Cloud using the $300 of free credits that they give to new users. But if you’re feeling adventurous, check out the hundreds of options on ServerHunter.com. You’ll want 300gb of disk space, and at least 4gb of RAM.

Chat with us on Session before paying for something, we’ll help you verify that it’s a good option.

### Self-hosting Zcash
But computers are everywhere! You might even have an extra one in your house.

It can be fun to host useful things on computers in your house. Many people do this, even using multiple computers - it’s called a “home lab”!

There are downsides to hosting something at home, however:
1. The computer needs to be online all of the time, never rebooting, and ideally is on a battery backup.
2. You risk revealing information to the world about where you live, through IP address leaks. (a unique identifier that your internet provider gives to your network)
3. If a hacker got access to your server, they could potentially access your home network unless you take advanced precautions.

If you’re comfortable with the risks, go for it! We’re happy to help and will release specific guides for this in the days ahead. We run a home lab ourselves!

## Now Decide _How_ to host Zcash.

For most people, we recommend using Docker to run Zcash.

Docker is a tool that packages apps and everything they need (code, dependencies, system tools) into standardized containers, so they run the same anywhere. It’s like a shipping container for software: keeping it isolated, portable, and easy to run on any computer.

If you want a more resilient solution and are okay with a more advanced approach, we can teach you how to run Zcash on Kubernetes. 

Kubernetes is a system that runs lots of containers across multiple computers and makes sure that the software stays online, even if some of the computers stop working. It can even grow and shrink automatically throughout the day. If more people need the software, it adds more computers and containers; if fewer people use it, it removes the extras to save money.

The major public clouds have Kubernetes platforms which offer many cool features. But they’re a bit expensive, and are centralized. If you’re okay with that, we recommend using Google’s $300 of free credits to try Google Kubernetes Engine.

A great thing about Kubernetes is that you don’t have to run it on a major cloud, you can run it yourself, even on one computer. You lose the benefits of a large company’s reliability, but you gain independence. Zec.rocks runs on dedicated servers that we maintain around the world, running Zcash on an easy Kubernetes distribution called “k3s”.

In the coming weeks we’ll talk more about the upsides and downsides to our approach, and if you want, we’ll walk you through how to set up your own globally-distributed Zec.rocks clone!

## Action Item 1: Pick a Hosting Provider

Google Cloud offers $300 in free credits, and is our recommendation for people looking for the least technical path forward.

Feeling adventurous? Browse ServerHunter.com for options. But contact us before paying for one, we'll help you make sure that you are picking a good option.

Remember, Zcash is decentralized software! You can completely delete it and start over fresh as many times as you like. You will not cause harm to the blockchain, it is synchronized across many computers around the world.

It’s important to note that we will not be storing any money in our Zcash nodes, we are contributing to the decentralization of the network instead of using its wallet functionality. So, try a few hosts out, and both our Docker and Kubernetes approaches, if you’d really like to learn about hosting! You can always reinstall and try again.


## Action Item 2: Configure Your Server

[Work in progress: This will be posted by Wednesday! Thank you for making it this far, say Hello in Chat!]
