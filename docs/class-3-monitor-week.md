# Welcome to the Zcash Node Workshop: Monitor Week!

## Workshop TLDR
    1. Set up a VM on hardware of choice 
    2. Launch the containers via Docker or Kubernetes on your VM
        ◦ Clone the git repo (https://github.com/zecrocks/zcash-stack) 
        ◦ Or our competitors (https://github.com/stakeholdrs/zcash-infra)
    3. Sync the blockchain (from scratch in ~10days or from download-snapshot.sh in ~10hours)
    4. Connect your new node to a wallet (perhaps using Cloudflare or Tailscale tunnel)
    5. Sit back and sip a red-bull knowing you are providing diversity and reliability to the privacy-coin Zcash ecosystem

    6. (!) Split your redbull all over the keyboard, get your feet off the desk, and stare open-mouthed at the screen...the servers are going down!

This week covers #6.
